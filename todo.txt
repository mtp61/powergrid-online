ERROR: lets you nominate plants not in market
subtracting money??


need to load in plants and map

if step 2 stuff doesn't seem to be working, just add more logging
add logging when doing step 3

big picture
    represent game state client side
    handle the game server side
    data entry

maybe .... need to add game logging before server logic is implemented in order to test shit


fucked up game css
game logged in and logged out different pages( do after css fix)

redirect to home page if already in game

only show X chat messages

add page to top bar with commands

Users
 - make sure there is not already a user with the same username - i think it already does this?? maybe
 - add a confirm password
 - store users in a file (eventually database)

Index
 - show more info about games in Index
 - delete game if there's no one in it or it's over


try to not have duplicated files (resources folder)

ALTERNATIVE IDEA FOR DRAWING CITIES...
just the number (or number and name) with three circles under, empty is unbought, colored is the person

add server messages, or better yet personal messages, for bot inputs, don't show it to everyone
