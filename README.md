# Powergrid Online

This project implements the board game Powergrid in javascript enabling real-time play in the browser. When I have the server running you can check the game out at http://powergrid.life/!

## The Program

This project was my first ambitious web project after making a very simple web game for school in the fall of 2019 (https://github.com/mtp61/multiplayer-game). My knowledge of node, npm, javascript, HTML, CSS, and express were very minimal when I started this project, and I’m sure much if not all of the project is poorly structured and implemented. Despite this, I’m pretty happy with the state of the game. You can log in, even if that information is only stored in a local variable, and the gameplay itself is mostly bug free. There is a nearly infinite amount of work that I could do to improve this project, but I think it will most likely just stay as is. 

## Playing the Game 

The game is played through commands in the chat window, which, while somewhat unintuitive, was the only realistic way for me to implement the game in a reasonable amount of time. A clickable UI for Powergrid would be a huge endeavor due to the high complexity of the game.
